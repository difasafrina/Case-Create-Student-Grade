# Mini Project

To create a DataFrame in Python using the pandas library, you can name the DataFrame `Rekap_Nilai_Student` and populate it with several data columns that take values from various variables: `ID Mahasiswa`, `Tugas`, `UTS`, `UAS`, and `information`.

## Create Data Frame

The `pd.DataFrame()` function from the pandas library is utilized to generate DataFrame objects. DataFrames are a highly common data structure in data science and data analysis due to their efficient table-like format, which is ideal for data manipulation and storage.

## Data Dictionary
To create this DataFrame, we populate it with data organized in dictionary form, where each dictionary key represents a column name and the corresponding value is the data for that column.
- 'ID Mahasiswa': This column stores data from the `ID` variable.
- 'Tugas': This column holds the assignment values from the `assignment` variable.
- 'UTS': This column contains the Midterm Exam scores from the `UTS` variable.
- 'UAS': This column includes the Final Semester Exam scores from the `UAS` variable.
-  'Description': This column stores information related to student performance or status from the `information` variable.

## Data Source Variables

`ID Mahasiswa`, `Tugas`, `UTS`, `UAS`, and `description are variables` that must be previously defined that store the data that will be entered into the DataFrame. This can be a list, array, or series from pandas.
